description: Explores user intent, requirements, and design before implementation. Use before any creative work, creating features, building components, adding functionality, or modifying behavior.

# Brainstorming Ideas Into Designs

## When to use this skill
- Before creating new features
- Before building components
- Before adding functionality
- Before modifying behavior that isn't a simple bug fix

## Overview

Help turn ideas into fully formed designs and specs through natural collaborative dialogue.

Start by understanding the current project context, then ask questions one at a time to refine the idea. Once you understand what you're building, present the design and get user approval.

<HARD-GATE>
Do NOT invoke any implementation skill, write any code, scaffold any project, or take any implementation action until you have presented a design and the user has approved it. This applies to EVERY project regardless of perceived simplicity.
</HARD-GATE>

## Checklist

You MUST create a task for each of these items and complete them in order:

1. **Explore project context** — check files, docs, recent commits
2. **Ask clarifying questions** — one at a time, understand purpose/constraints/success criteria
3. **Propose 2-3 approaches** — with trade-offs and your recommendation
4. **Present design** — in sections scaled to their complexity, get user approval after each section
5. **Write design doc** — save to `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md` and commit
6. **Transition to implementation** — invoke planning skill to create implementation plan

## Process Flow

1. **Explore project context** -> **Ask clarifying questions**
2. **Ask clarifying questions** -> **Propose 2-3 approaches**
3. **Propose 2-3 approaches** -> **Present design sections**
4. **Present design sections** -> **User approves design?**
   - No -> Revise and present again
   - Yes -> **Write design doc**
5. **Write design doc** -> **Invoke planning skill**

**The terminal state is invoking planning.** Do NOT invoke frontend-design, mcp-builder, or any other implementation skill. The ONLY skill you invoke after brainstorming is planning.

## Instructions

**Understanding the idea:**
- Check out the current project state first (files, docs, recent commits)
- Ask questions one at a time to refine the idea
- Prefer multiple choice questions when possible, but open-ended is fine too
- Only one question per message - if a topic needs more exploration, break it into multiple questions
- Focus on understanding: purpose, constraints, success criteria

**Exploring approaches:**
- Propose 2-3 different approaches with trade-offs
- Present options conversationally with your recommendation and reasoning
- Lead with your recommended option and explain why

**Presenting the design:**
- Once you believe you understand what you're building, present the design
- Scale each section to its complexity: a few sentences if straightforward, up to 200-300 words if nuanced
- Ask after each section whether it looks right so far
- Cover: architecture, components, data flow, error handling, testing
- Be ready to go back and clarify if something doesn't make sense

## After the Design

**Documentation:**
- Write the validated design to `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md`
- Commit the design document to git

**Implementation:**
- Invoke the planning skill to create a detailed implementation plan
- Do NOT invoke any other skill. planning is the next step.
